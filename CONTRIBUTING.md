# Contributing to gswidgetkit

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. We're excited to have you!

gswidgetkit is a wxPython extension library originally created for use in [Gimel Studio](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio) and the same forums, etc can be used to discuss gswidgetkit.

The main purpose of the gswidgetkit package is to provide widgets and common utilities for use in Gimel Studio. Since Gimel Studio directy relies on this package, some issues in the main Gimel Studio repository will make reference to something that needs to be fixed/implemented here.

Please see the Gimel Studio [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for overall guidelines and details on contributing.
